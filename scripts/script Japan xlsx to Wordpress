# A Guide to Nakameguro - Tokyo‚Äôs Center of Cool üå∏üèôÔ∏è

[**Location on Google Maps**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dy5Ji59DqfkB8LRAA)

## **The Sophisticated Side of the City** ‚ú®

Centered around the **Meguro River** and within walking distance of the trendy districts of Daikanyama and Ebisu, Nakameguro holds its own in the sophistication stakes. The area is home to a range of **cool cafes and restaurants**, hip interior and accessory shops, and the **Nakameguro Koukashita**‚Äî700 meters of bars and stores anchored by the uber-modern bookstore **Nakameguro Tsutaya Books**. Nakameguro is a bustling bastion of cool throughout the year, but you'll find the crowds swell in late March and early April when the densely packed riverside cherry trees bud and blossom, creating an ultra-photogenic tunnel of pink.

## **Cherry Blossom** üå∏

At the end of March through early April, the cherry tree-lined **Meguro River** that slices through Nakameguro draws huge crowds buzzing with cherry blossom enthusiasm. The connecting trees on both sides of the river touch branches, creating a tunnel flanked by small stalls selling snacks and refreshing beers. Finding a quiet spot can be a challenge, especially at night when the trees are lit up. One way to avoid the crowds is to take a daytime or nighttime ‚Äú**Hanami (Flower Viewing) Cruise**‚Äù that pushes off from Tennozu Isle‚Äôs Yamatsu Pier and travels to the area. While the cherry blossoms might be short-lived, the trees become a fresh, verdant green, offering you some well-needed shade from the intense summer heat.

## **Nakameguro‚Äôs Starbucks Reserve ¬Æ Roastery Tokyo** ‚òïüåø

Nakameguro‚Äôs **Starbucks Reserve¬Æ Roastery Tokyo** is one of only six Starbucks roasteries in the world. The building, designed by **Kengo Kuma**, contains a roasting factory, cocktail bar, tea floor, bakery, and cafe. The outdoor terrace is the perfect spot for viewing the cherry blossoms."""

# **Discover the Retro Charm of Traditional Shopping Streets, Shotengai üõçÔ∏èüèôÔ∏è**

## **Shotengai: Tokyo's Hidden Treasure**

The ancient Japanese shopping streets, known as **shotengai**, are slowly disappearing due to the rise of supermarkets and chain stores. However, examples like Yanaka Ginza show that some shotengai still manage to thrive, offering a unique retro charm.

### **Yanaka Ginza: A Flourishing Shotengai**

Located just steps from Nippori Station, about 15 minutes on the JR Yamanote Line from Tokyo Station, Yanaka Ginza is a vibrant example of shotengai. With its independent shops selling meat, fish, vegetables, ready-made food, tea, and traditional Japanese wagashi sweets made in small artisan batches, this street represents the best of tradition.

### **Summer Festival and Local Community**

During the early August summer festival, Yanaka Ginza reveals its crucial role in bringing together the local community, offering an authentic and engaging experience.

### **A Balance of Tourism and Tradition**

Although the street is popular among tourists, especially on weekends, visiting in the evening on a weekday reveals a predominance of local shoppers. The 175-meter-long street is famous for its atmosphere that takes you back in time, appealing to both Japanese and foreign visitors.

### **Unique Shopping and Traditional Souvenirs**

Yanaka Ginza is the ideal place to purchase reasonably priced traditional souvenirs, such as chopsticks, folding fans, or Japanese sweets, in an environment free of pushy sellers.

### **A Dive into History: From Edo to Showa**

Although sometimes presented as an Edo period (1603-1868) experience, the street mainly has an atmosphere from the mid-20th century, typical of the Showa period (1926-1989), and seems to have formed in its current shape immediately after World War II.

### **Special Attractions: Cats and Panoramic View**

- **Cats**: During less crowded periods, you can see cats roaming the street or admire the statues of the seven lucky cats along the way.
- **Breathtaking View (_y≈´yake dandan_)**: At the beginning of the shopping street, there are stairs that offer a splendid view of the sunset. Despite an altitude of only 4.4 meters, these stairs allow you to observe the street from a different perspective, ideal for taking unforgettable photos."""

# **Omoide Yokocho Shinjuku: A Slice of History in the Heart of Tokyo** üèôÔ∏èüç¢

## **A Maze of Narrow and Colorful Alleys**

**Omoide Yokocho** in Shinjuku, Tokyo, is a labyrinth of small alleyways filled with izakaya-style restaurants, attracting both office workers and foreign visitors.

## **Contrast with Shinjuku's Modernity** üöâ

Despite Shinjuku station often being described as the busiest in the world and predominantly modern, Omoide Yokocho offers a stark contrast with its narrow lanes and traditional eateries. This maze of streets near the west exit of Shinjuku station feels like a step back in time, with its open barbecue stalls and a bustling, multicultural atmosphere.

## **The History of Omoide Yokocho** üï∞Ô∏è

Translating to "Memory Lane," the area of Omoide Yokocho started as a large black market in the period immediately following World War II. The area, once dangerous, has transformed into a vibrant district of restaurants, retaining the rebellious spirit of the black market, yet now consisting of regularly licensed restaurants.

## **Omoide Yokocho Today** üåÜ

Today, Omoide Yokocho is a safe and lively place to visit. It's the perfect spot to sit down, order a drink, and enjoy small typical dishes. The restaurants offer English menus, and the atmosphere is ideal for people-watching, a real spectacle in the heart of Tokyo that combines the tradition of local sumo wrestlers with the modernity of international tourists.

## **Cuisine and Rules of Omoide Yokocho** üç∫

Although there is a variety of food, the general rule in Omoide Yokocho is quick-prepared izakaya food, especially grilled: seafood, chicken (yakitori in all its variations), meat, and grilled offal. It's important to remember that it is necessary to order food with drinks here, and despite no smoking signs in the alleys, smoking is allowed while seated in the restaurants."""
